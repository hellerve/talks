# Config Management Camp 2020

This is a talk that [Christian Dieckhoff](https://gitlab.com/ChrisDeh) and I
proposed to the Config Management Camp. It’s a user story on network
automation using Netbox, Gitlab, and Ansible. The full title is “Automate your
ISP on OSS”. It is based on our talks at the [Neutral Interconnect Days et
al.](/neutral_interconnect_days_2019).

Sadly we didn’t get to go in the end, since personal things came up.

You can look at [the abstract](./abstract.md).
