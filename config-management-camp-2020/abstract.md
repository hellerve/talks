Automation shouldn't be hard, and implementing it shouldn't require expensive
proprietary tools. Many of us still rely on these tools or on hacky homegrown
systems, because in reality writing a bunch of scripts is still the closest some
of us ever get to automating their network.

In our talk, we'll walk through a change in an ISP’s system from planning to
execution. The process will be automated using source components such as
Netbox, Gitlab, and Ansible, and in the end we won’t have had to touch our
configurations to deploy our change.
