# Datengarten January 2019

This is a talk I gave at [Datengarten
96](https://berlin.ccc.de/wiki/Datengarten), the 96th installment of a monthly
event hosted by CCC Berlin. I talked about compilers and interpreters, what
they are, how they work, and what it means to trust your compiler.

A recording of the talk can be found [online](https://api.media.ccc.de/v/dg-96).
