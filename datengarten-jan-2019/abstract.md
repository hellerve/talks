# Programming Languages and Trust

## The what, why, and how (and the hacks)

Compilers and interpreters are the foundation of programming languages, the
first tier in software abstraction. They come in all sizes, shapes, and colors,
and they power all kinds of programming languages. For many of us they are black
boxes.

In the first section of this talk we’ll try to look into the box: how do
compilers and interpreters actually work? After a bit of foundational
information, we’ll look at a silly, simple virtual machine and JIT compiler
built by yours truly. In the second part, we’re going to see how much trust we
put into our compilers, and whether that’s always a good idea.
