## Want me to speak?

If you want me to speak at your conference/meetup/all-weekend rave, you might
want to know what I’m interested in talking about first. A non-exhaustive list:

- [Carp](https://github.com/carp-lang/carp)
- [Generative Art](https://veitheller.de/art/)
- [Abstractions](/enthusiasticon-2019)
- [How you can leverage macros to implement language features](https://blog.veitheller.de/scheme-macros/)
- [Types](/clojutre-2019)

If you find any of these interesting or think you might have a different topic
for me, [feel free to reach out](mailto:veit@veitheller.de)! My interests are
legion, I just might have some thoughts on whatever you have lying around at
home.
