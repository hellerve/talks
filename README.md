# talks

This repository compiles all the talks I have given and proposals I’ve submitted
to conferences.

It is a more general version of my [Carp talks](https://github.com/hellerve/carp-talks)
repository, where I collect all of the talks I’ve given or proposed on Carp.

## Overview

Right now, the talks I’ve given/proposed are these:

- [Various talks on Carp](https://github.com/hellerve/carp-talks)
- [A talk](https://github.com/hellerve/release-party) I’ve given at the release
  party of [zepto](https://github.com/zepto-lang/zepto), a Lisp of my own making
- [“Programming Languages and Trust” at Datengarten 96](https://api.media.ccc.de/v/dg-96)
- [“Programming Languages and Trust” (short version) at the Information Security Meetup Berlin](/security-meetup-berlin-march-2019)
- [“Leveraging macros to reimplement language features”](/clojure-berlin-late-2018) [Proposed]

## Want me to speak?

If you want me to speak at your conference/meetup/all-night rave, you might want
to know what I’m interested in talking about first. A non-exhaustive list:

- [Carp](https://github.com/carp-lang/carp)
- [Generative Art](https://veitheller.de/art/)
- [Abstractions](https://blog.veitheller.de/Abstractions.html)
- [How you can leverage macros to implement language features](https://blog.veitheller.de/scheme-macros/)

If you find any of these interesting or think you might have a different topic
for me, [feel free to reach out](mailto:veit@veitheller.de)!
