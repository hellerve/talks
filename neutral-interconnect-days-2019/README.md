# Neutal Interconnect Days 2019

This is a talk that I will be giving at Neutal Interconnect Days 2019, together
with [Christian Dieckhoff](https://gitlab.com/ChrisDeh), on network automation using
Netbox, Gitlab, and Ansible. The full title is “Automate yourself within six months”.

You can look at [the abstract](./abstract.md).
