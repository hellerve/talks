# Neutal Interconnect Days 2019 et al.

This is a talk that I gave at Neutal Interconnect Days 2019, at NetUse AG, and
at DENOG 11, together with [Christian Dieckhoff](https://gitlab.com/ChrisDeh),
on network automation using Netbox, Gitlab, and Ansible. The full title is
“Automate yourself within six months”.

You can look at [the abstract](./abstract.md) or [the recording from
DENOG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysGBGRxhk4Y).
