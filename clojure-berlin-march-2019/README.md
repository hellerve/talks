# Clojure Meetup March 2019

This is a talk that I’m giving at the Clojure Meetup Berlin about macros. The
full title is “Leveraging macros to reimplement language features”.

Because I had spoken there [just before about Carp](https://github.com/hellerve/carp-talks/tree/master/clojure-meetup-berlin-oct-2018),
I left it open when to give the talk—so as not to speak there too often. I
proposed in late 2018, and it’s scheduled to happen on the 14th of March 2019.

You can look at [the abstract](./abstract.md), [the slides](./talk.pdf) and [the
code I want to talk about](./code.clj).
