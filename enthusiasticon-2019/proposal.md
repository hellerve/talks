*Title*: Abstractions! How do I even?

*Abstract*:

All we ever build when we create software is abstractions—layers upon layers of
stuff to hide the stuff we don’t find as aesthetically pleasing or usable
underneath. This is a useful activity, but not necessarily one that take a lot
of time studying as technologists.

There is one profession, however, that has been trying to study, separate, and
generally figure out abstractions: philosophers! In this talk, we’re going to
see what exciting, funny, sad, and mind-boggling insights some philosophers and
authors have for us, and how we can add those to our mindset to build better
abstractions, without having to read thousands of pages full of labyrinthine
sentences that you need a map and a PhD for[1]!

Ideally, you’d walk away from this talk inspired and intellectually tickled,
though I won’t pass up on pure entertainment, either! If I can show you that
thinking hard about abstractions can be fun rather than dull then I’ve
fulfilled all of my goals!

[1]: Though I’ll give you a reference/reading list at the end, if decyphering
     obscure texts is your sort of thing!

*Speaker Bio*:

Veit is a jack of all trades, but a master of none. He frequently oscillates
between compiler development, writing, creating generative art, and trying to
get work done at his day job.
