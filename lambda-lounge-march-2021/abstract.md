Lisp macros are known to be a powerful and scary feature for metaprogramming. We rely on it heavily in Carp, a statically compiled and typed language, both to generate code and to build abstractions.

In this talk, weâ€™re going to build a little Brainfuck compiler in the Carp macro system that will emit Carp code true to the Brainfuck input program. What could be more fun than a compiler inside another compiler?
