Lisp Macros are one of those concepts in programming that have a reputation:
people love them, hate them, think they are too complicated, or the key to
enlightenment. In this workshop, we’re going to explore what all the fuss is
about!

We’re going to start from zero, talking about the fundamentals of Lisp and what
macros are about, and why they are useful. We are then going to fight our way
through increasingly complex macros, and we’ll see whether it takes to
enlightenment or a state of utter confusion. With macros, anything is possible!
