# Clojure Meetup Late 2018

This is a proposal that I submitted to the Clojure Meetup Berlin about macros.
The full title is “Leveraging macros to reimplement language features”.

Because I had spoken there [just before about Carp](https://github.com/hellerve/carp-talks/tree/master/clojure-meetup-berlin-oct-2018),
I left it open when to give the talk—so as not to speak there too often.

You can look at [the abstract](./abstract.md) and [some of the code I want to
talk about](./code.clj).
