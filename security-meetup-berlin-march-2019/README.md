# Berlin Security Meetup March 2019

This is a talk I gave at the Berlin Information Security Meetup. I talked about
what it means to trust your compiler. It is basically a condensed version of
the talk I gave at [Datengarten 96](/datengarten-jan-2019) where I limit myself
to the second part of the original talk and extend on that a little bit.
