# Programming Languages and Trust

Compilers and interpreters are the foundation of programming languages, the
first tier in software abstraction. They come in all sizes, shapes, and colors,
and they power all kinds of programming languages. For many of us they are black
boxes.

In this talk, we’re going to see how much trust we put into our programming
languages, and whether that’s always a good idea. We’re going to see how the
tools we rarely audit can compromise our systems, with no trace in source code.
