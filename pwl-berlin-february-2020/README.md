# Papers We Love Berlin February 2020

This is a talk I gave at Papers We Love in February 2020 about the classic
Lambda Paper [“SCHEME: An Interpreter for Extended Lambda
Calculus”](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5794) by Steele and Sussman.

You can look at [the abstract](./abstract.md), and [the slides](./talk.pdf).
