In the latter half of the 1970s, Gerald J. Sussman and Guy L. Steele published
acseries of ground-breaking papers on their new dialect and implementation of
Lisp, Scheme. All of them are worth examining, and in this talk we will look at
the first paper in the series: “Scheme: An Interpreter for Extended Lambda
Calculus”. We’ll look at some of the design choices and rationale, the
historical context of the decisions, and try to understand some of the more
interesting code snippets in the paper.
