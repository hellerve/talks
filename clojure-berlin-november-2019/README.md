# Clojure Meetup Berlin 2019

This is a talk that I gave at the Clojure Meetup Berlin about macros. The full
title is “Enhancing Your Libraries’ Security and Performance through Macros”.
It’s scheduled for the 13th of November 2019.

You can look at [the abstract](./abstract.md), [the slides](./talk.pdf) and [the
code I want to talk about](./code.clj).
