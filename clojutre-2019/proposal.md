*Title*: Types—A Hitchhiker’s Guide

*List of things it is about*: types,hindley-milner,proofs,fearlessness

*Abstract*:

Types: you either love them or you hate them. But as with any concept in
Computering, there are times when they are helpful as often as there are times
when they are just plain annoying. They are a tool that is misunderstood as an
ideology.

We’re going to talk a little bit about different type systems and their
tradeoffs, what we win and we lose when we use types, and why big words like
“Curry-Howard Correspondence”, “Parametric Polymorphism”, or “Dependent pair
type” don’t have to be scary. No PhD required.

*Fits*: General functional programming track

*Have you given talks before*:

I’ve given talks at clojuTRE (2018), curry-on (July 2019), localhost (Oct 2018), EnthusiastiCon (2018&2019), and various meetups (since 2016).

*Bio*:

Veit is a jack of all trades, but a master of none. He frequently oscillates between compiler development, writing, creating generative art, and trying to get work done at his day job.
