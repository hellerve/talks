# ?

I proposed a talk to [!!Con 2021](http://bangbangcon.com/) in  which I want to
talk about how to take an interpreter and turn it into a compiler with a bit
of creativity and very little black magic.

You can look at the [abstract](abstract.md), the [timeline](timeline.md), or
the [code I want to present](bangbang.lisp).
