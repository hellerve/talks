2 min: Intro to Brainfuck and Common Lisp, and what are compilers/interpreters even?
  - The general ideas of Brainfuck (what the heck is a Turing machine?!)
  - The general idea of Common Lisp (parentheses everywhere!!)
  - Compilers vs Interpreters: sometimes one, sometimes both, a fuzzy distinction!
3 min: Writing a Brainfuck interpreter in Common Lisp
  - Simulating a Turing machine is easy!
  - The basics of moving the tape head and changing numbers around
  - Wait, how do we do loops?
3 min: Summoning a compiler from the void
  - Let’s look at our interpreter! Hey, we already have compiler building blocks!
  - Rejig the evaluator: from function to macro, from expression to data
  - Wait, that’s it? Yup, we can generate code!
2 min: The general idea!
  - Sometimes an interpreter is just a compiler that works at runtime, kindasorta?!
  - The scary art of Futamura projections and other black magic (which this talk definitely is not!)
  - Go forth and turn things inside out!
