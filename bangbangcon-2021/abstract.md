Interpreters are cool! Compilers are also cool, but  they have a reputation of being even harder to write—sometimes unjustly so!

In this talk we’re going to take a useless-but-fun interpreter of the Brainfuck programming language—written in Common Lisp for maximum obscurity—, look at it real hard, snap our fingers, and turn it into a compiler! Well, maybe we’ll have to change a handful of lines of code, too. In the end, you’ll know a little about Brainfuck, a little about Common Lisp, a little about compilers, and definitely enough to be very dangerous!
