# EnthusiastiCon 2020

This is a talk that I gave at EnthusiastiCon 2020 about abstractions. The
full title is “All I have is a hammer, now give me your nails!”.

You can look at [the proposal](./proposal.md), [the slides](./talk.pdf),
[the transcript](./notes.md), or [the video](https://youtu.be/EkbcI3KgUuY?t=8360).
