*Title*: All I have is a hammer, now give me your nails!

*Abstract*:

Have you heard the old adage “if all you have is a hammer, everything looks
like a nail”? It’s one of those proverbs that make sense at first—cultivating a
diverse toolbox is usually a good idea.

But once you get to the other end of the spectrum, you arrive at a comparably
interesting—and I would argue, comparably useful—paradigm. I don’t know that
this concept has a name, but I like to think of it as asking the question “what
if everything was a...”

A lot of the most revered, feared, loved, and hated languages fall into that
category: Lisp, APL, SmallTalk, and Forth, to name only a few.

In my talk, I’m going to explore why this paradigm might be interesting, and
how you can tackle problems if all you have is a hammer by forming some nails.

*Speaker Bio*:

Veit is a jack of all trades, but a master of none. He frequently oscillates
between compiler development, writing, creating generative art, and trying to
get work done at his day job.

*Intended Audience*:

I’m going to keep this very fundamental, so everyone who has ever written
software and thought about writing software should take away at least something.
People who have touched at least one of the programming languages listed will
feel right at home, but that’s not a prerequisite.
